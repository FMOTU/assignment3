Web and Script Assignment 3


Application Requirements 

	1. Project Plan

The project plan is a workout tracker. The tracker will be in a table that contains, Exercise Name, Sets, Repetitions, Rest Time, Intensity, and Day. The Idea is that I can add information to the tracker after I finish up a workout. So under the intensity Section I will put a percent of my estimated 1 rep max for a workout. For example, 85% 1RM means 85% of my 1 rep max. If my 1 rep max is 100 lbs., then 85% 1RM is 85 lbs.  After a training session, I can update the Day section to put my actual information in from my session. Some sessions you have more energy and drive and can easily lift more than what is programmed for you. 

An example graph to illustrate what I am talking about. 

Exercise	Sets	Reps	Rest	Intensity	Day 1	Day 2
Machine Shoulder Press 	4	3-6	2-3 Min	90% 1RM	175 lbs.	180lbs.
Heavy Lateral Raise	4	5-8	1-2 Min	75% 1RM	25 lbs.	25 lbs.
Dumbbell Lateral Raise	4	10-15/5/5/5	1-2 Min	70% 1RM	20 lbs.	20 lbs.
Incline Bench Press	4	7-10	1-2 Min	80% 1RM	135 lbs.	155 lbs.
Close Grip Bench Press (Triceps)	4	7-10	1-2 Min	80% 1RM	145 lbs.	155 lbs.
Triceps Cable Pulldowns 	4	7-10	1-2 Min	65% 1RM	65 lbs.	70 lbs.

I will be able to add to my day after a session in the gym. Knowing that you need to target most muscles 2 to 3 times a week for optimal growth. This chart would be updated daily. However for this assignment I will just have the workout tracker on my push days. Push days refers to my training split at the moment, Push Pull Legs. This split is a 6 day a week routine where you have 72 hours between muscle groups. Push refers to "pushing" muscles, chest, anterior delts, triceps that is why this particular chart has those exercises on it. If I were to have all my workouts on here it would have the other pull and leg workouts. Also I would be able to give this to a client and adjust information for them as required. So for example I could have multiple tabs sections of the website that contain each different training day. Like the example earlier I could have instead of a home page, service page etc. I could have Push page, pull page, leg page. The client can access the website I am hosting and see the information I post, I can even allow them to just edit what they did that day (The lifted category here). I can edit everything else if I need to change something for them, or adjust their split.
